    Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956) is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show). He is the spouse
    of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be 239 pounds), lazy,
    and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love,
    and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also serves as the main
    protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie. Homer Simpson is in his late 30s and early 40s.
