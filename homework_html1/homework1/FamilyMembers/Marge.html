    Marjorie Jacqueline "Marge" Simpson (née Bouvier)[11] is the homemaker and matriarch of the Simpson family. She is
    also one of the five main characters in The Simpsons TV series. Marge Simpson is 36 years old. She and her husband
    Homer have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Marge is the moralistic force in her family and often provides a
    grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. Aside from
    her duties at home, Marge has flirted briefly with a number of careers ranging from a police officer to an
    anti-violence activist.
